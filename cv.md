## About me
I love to learn everything new and exciting. And I can spend a lot of time doing what interests me.
I am attentive to details, assiduous and patient.
I started my way in learning by studying HTML code and I came to rs-school to expand and deepen my knowledge.
I would like to become a specialist in front-end development and I am ready to make every effort to achieve this.
